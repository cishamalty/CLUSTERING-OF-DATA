# BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SOLUTION
We have a ‘Mall’ data set containing the customer’s demographic data (i.e. Name, Gender, Age, Salary & Spending Score).
Spending Score is based on their previous purchases from 1-100. Now our project will make clusters of these customers based on their details. 
Eventually we make the advertising strategy accordingly
Currently the advertising strategy is not much efficient as the target customers are not focused correctly and the company 
has to spend a lot in advertising with minimal returns. So , our main aim is to improve that advertising strategy by dividing 
the customers into different groups by the help of clustering. The code is given in .ipynb file in repository.
The result is in proimg file given in repository
